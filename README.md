### Notes
---
- Rearview mirrors can only be found in backpacks. They are also sold by the [Merchant](https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/merchant) if you have that loaded.
- Loadout code is `rvm`.
- Using the item toggles it on and off. Do this if you notice significant performance drops as it has to render the scene once for each mirror.
- Use + Use Item switches shoulder mount. Only works if you have one mirror for obvious reasons.
- Up to two mirrors can be utilized, one for each shoulder.
